Task Description
The objective of this task is to migrate data from a MySQL database (source_db) to a PostgreSQL database (target_db) while ensuring data integrity is preserved throughout the process. This is a common real-world requirement when transitioning systems or modernizing legacy infrastructure.

The deliverables include the migration scripts and a summary report outlining the entire migration process from start to finish.

üìÅ Steps & Included Files
1. migration_mysql_to_postgresql.sh
This Bash script handles the automated migration process with the following steps:

Utilizes mysqldump to export the full schema and data from the MySQL database.

Separates and cleans up:

The schema structure (converted using schema_conversion.sql)

The data (INSERT statements extracted from the MySQL dump)

Creates the target PostgreSQL database, if it doesn't already exist.

Imports the PostgreSQL-compatible schema and data into the target database.

Verifies data migration by comparing row counts (e.g., for a sample table like employees) between the source and target databases.

2. schema_conversion.sql
This file contains the PostgreSQL-compatible CREATE TABLE statements that replicate the original MySQL schema.
Key conversions include:

Replacing MySQL's AUTO_INCREMENT with PostgreSQL's SERIAL.

Removing MySQL-specific syntax like backticks (`).

Adapting data types and constraints to match PostgreSQL standards.

Example:
The MySQL table for employees is transformed to a clean PostgreSQL-compatible structure.

Step 1: Setting up MySQL and PostgreSQL Environments
Both MySQL and PostgreSQL servers are configured and running locally or via containers.

Step 2: Creating & Exporting the MySQL Database
A complete export of the source MySQL database is performed using mysqldump.

Step 3: Extracting INSERT Queries
The dump file is parsed to separate the INSERT statements for use in PostgreSQL.

Step 4: Importing Tables into PostgreSQL
The converted schema and extracted data are successfully imported into the PostgreSQL target database using psql.
